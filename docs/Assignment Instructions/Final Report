For the final report you will provide the following:



Planning and Requirements - What was your overall plan from the beginning in Week 1, how well did you follow the plan, and what changes did you make as you went. How complete were your requirements? Did you think you met the requirements? What evidence do you have that you met the requirements?
System Architecture & Design - Was your System Architecture and Design sufficient to help understand what the system was supposed to be/do, and did it map to your requirements? Did it help you develop/choose your technology stack?
Prototyping and Implementation - How much of the original requirements and design were you actually able to implement/demonstrate? Did you implement the core functionality (registration, viewing cars, booking). Has all of your work been committed to GIT? (You must show a summary or your commits as part of this report)
Evidence of testing. This can be a summary of what testing you performed; whatever it is.
Submit screenshots/video of functionality.
Write final reflection on challenges and lessons learned. Be honest. There is no wrong answer, only an articulate and inciteful  response will get full credit.
